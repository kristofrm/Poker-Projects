# Poker-Projects

Simple Poker Project was my intro to python final project. 
The basic idea of this code is to simulate a game of poker against the computer with interactive betting options and integrated final card evaluation to determine the winner of each round.
Even after I initially submitted the project, I've come back to it multiple times to tweak code, add new code, and optimize existing code.
Given my beginner status at the time of this code's creation, this project remains a work in progress, albeit a functional one. 

Poker Probability is an extension of the above project.
Since I already had functions to determine whether a pool of 7 cards fulfilled the requirements for a given hand ranking, I added more code to repeatedly deal and evaluate the dealt cards until the desired hand ranking was achieved. 
Once data on how many deals it took to reach the desired hand ranking is collected, probability information for that hand ranking is printed.
